'''
Random Node:
You are implementing a binary tree class from scratch which, in addition to insert, find and delete, has a method
getRandomeNode() which returns a random node from the tree. All nodes should be equally likely to be chosen.
Design and implement an algorithm for getRandomeNode, and explain how you would implement the rest of the methods.
