'''
You have two numbers represented by a linkedlist, where each mode contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a lined list.
EXAMPLE
Input:(7->1->6) + (5->9->2). That is 617 + 295
Output:2->-1->9. That is 912
FOLLOW UP
Suppose the digits are stored in the forward order. Repeat the above algorithm.
EXAMPLE
Input: (6->1->7) + (2->9->5). That is 617 + 295
Output: 9->1->2. That is 912.
